# How to Deploy to Render
You can click [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FIKKEM-Lin%2Ftina-self-hosted-template) to deploy this template to [render](https://render.com/). You don't need any environment variables because it has been pre-config in [render.yaml](https://github.com/IKKEM-Lin/tina-self-hosted-template/blob/main/render.yaml).
